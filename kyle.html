With that being said, the vast majority of the United States population supports the legalization of recreational marijuana.<br><br>Allowing the use of Recreational Marijuana would be supporting and representing what the citizens of the United States want. Not only is Marijuana Legalization supported by 66% of United States adult citizens, but itâ€™s a newly booming industry. According to Investors Business Daily, California, a state that allows the legalization of recreational marijuana, brought in around $74.2 million in marijuana industry tax revenue during the second quarter, up 22% from the first three months of the year. The legalization of recreational marijuana would support the vast majority of what citizens want, and help boost the economy.
