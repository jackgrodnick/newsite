To secure our border, we will need to build a wall. A wall might be an old concept, but data shows they are still very effective to this day with Israel's border fence stopping 99% of illegal immigration and many other countries with border walls and fences showing similar data. A is a proven and effective way we will secure our borders and deliver on our promise to stop illegal immigration.<br><br>Some people think illegal immirgrants coming into our country isn't a big deal because they've heard that illegal immigrants are less likely than citizens to commit crimes but this is false. Studies have shown that illegal immigrants are more likely to commit crimes in almost every aspect with them more likely to be arrested for drunk driving and are three times more likely of committing murder. Our solution for selecting immigrants to come it would interview to learn about there past and what they want to contribute to American. This will help filter bad apples out and ensure that the people that come into America are law obeying citizens.<br><br>We also will reform our birthright law which makes it easier for illegal immigrants to become citizens in a non-lawful way. There is no reason to have the birthright law applied to illegal immigrants because they shouldn't even be in the country and our breaking our laws but expect us to obey laws by giving them citizenship which doesn't make sense. We will reform our birthright law by only applying it to citizens which will help enforce legally applying for citizenship.
