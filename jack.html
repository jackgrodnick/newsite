To secure our border, we will need to build a wall. A wall might be an old concept, but data shows they are still very effective to this day with Israel's border fence stopping 99% of illegal immigration and many other countries with border walls and fences showing similar data. A wall is a proven and effective way we will secure our borders and deliver on our promise to stop illegal immigration.<br><br>Securing our border with a wall will also help prevent drugs from coming into our country from Mexico which is how over 99% of drugs get in. With over 72,00 Americans dying each year from opioids building a wall should be the countries number one priority to help decrease the supply of drugs coming in and prevent countless lives.<br><br>We also will reform our birthright law which makes it easier for illegal immigrants to become citizens in a non-lawful way. There is no reason to have the birthright law applied to illegal immigrants because they shouldn't even be in the country and are breaking our laws but expect us to obey laws by giving them citizenship which doesn't make sense. We will reform our birthright law by only applying it to citizens which will help enforce legally applying for citizenship.<br><br>We will also reform the way we legalize citizens. The process to become a citizen shouldn't be a test where you pass and are accepted despite of other characteristics. It should be several interviews to learn what you want to contribute to America and what your dreams are. These interviews will help filter out bad apples and pick out the gems of the bunch that really want to change there life for the better. The goal for this process is too cute down on the time it takes to become a citizen from several years to being accepted within a year while making sure the people that come into this country are here to contribute to the success of the united states and not to harm it.
