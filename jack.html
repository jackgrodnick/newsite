To secure our border, we will need to build a wall. A wall might be an old concept, but data shows they are still very effective to this day with Israel's border fence stopping 99% of illegal immigration and many other countries with border walls and fences showing similar data. A wall is a proven and effective way we will secure our borders and deliver on our promise to stop illegal immigration.<br><br>Securing our border with a wall will also help prevent drugs from coming into our country from Mexico which is how over 99% of drugs get in. With over 72,00 Americans dying each year from opioids building a wall should be the countries number one priority to help decrease the supply of drugs coming in and prevent countless lives.<br><br>We also will reform our birthright law which makes it easier for illegal immigrants to become citizens in a non-lawful way. There is no reason to have the birthright law applied to illegal immigrants because they shouldn't even be in the country and our breaking our laws but expect us to obey laws by giving them citizenship which doesn't make sense. We will reform our birthright law by only applying it to citizens which will help enforce legally applying for citizenship.
