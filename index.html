But at the time they thought the government was failing itself in protecting the freedom of the citizens so they took action and formed the were right party. Since they lean more conservative they were on the right side of the spectrum and that’s how they got their name. After their first meeting they figured out there ideologies and from that day on the party grew rapidly.</div>

      <div class="contenttt3"><h1 class="lilly-b">About Lilly</h1><br>Road To Presidency
By: Lilly Langhus<br><br>

My name is Lillian Abigail Langhus. I was born in Golden Valley, Minnesota and grew up
in Plymouth. I’m 37 years old and I’m running for President of the United States. Growing up, I
took a fair amount of interest in politics. My father was very passionate about politics and often
discussed big ideas in the car or at dinner with us. I enjoyed these discussions. In highschool, it
was hard to avoid politics. Donald Trump was president and everyone, including me, started to
really pay attention to our government and especially our new President. As high school came
to a close, it was clear to me I wanted to study politics in college so that I could one day come
back and serve my city and state.<br>
I majored in political science at Duke University. Even though I was incredibly interested
in politics, I never voiced my opinion. As a kid, I was an introvert and wanted to avoid
confrontation at all costs. My political views were private views. This meant it was very unlikely
for me to be where I am today. In my sophomore year at Duke, we had a debate in class on
weather we thought the minimum wage should be higher, and we had to choose a side. This
was the first time I had to speak out on my political views. To my surprise, I liked it. I enjoyed
debating and voicing my opinion. I liked getting to argue about issues and saying all the things
I’d wanted to say for years. After that, I was much more comfortable speaking out on what I
believed.<br>
After I graduated, I took a job at City Hall in Plymouth, Minnesota. I worked in the Parks
and Recreation department. My job was to make sure all of the parks were well taken care of
and our city had good sports and programs for kids. I loved it! Three years later, I was head of
the Parks and Recreation Department and looking to move up. I had that job for about four
years when a seat on the city council opened up and I decided to run. This was a close race. A
lot of the public thought I was too young and unqualified, but I fought hard, had a great team
and I ended up winning. As a councilwoman, I worked to to replace the dying mall with a
beautiful shopping center and helped spearhead a program to make our local parks beautiful. I
enjoyed this job and I especially enjoyed seeing my city of Plymouth thrive.
One night, at a cocktail party for City Hall employees, I was approached by Barbra
Molli.She told me that Jake Johnson, the Governor of Minnesota, was retiring. Barbra Molli was
part of a group that was looking for potential candidates to replace him and they thought I was a
good candidate. I, of course, said I would run. I connected with my old campaign manager and
he agreed to help. This election was a very close race. We ran commercials both attacking my
opponent and clearly stating my vision for Minnesota. We made merchandise and signs and
hosted parties for the volunteers and donors . On election day, I hosted another party for all the
people who worked in my campaign. When they announced who won, I almost screamed
because I won by 5 votes. My opponent called for a recount, and again, I won by 5 votes. I
couldn’t believe it.<br><br>

I enjoyed being governor. It was definitely what I was meant to do. I had to make a lot of
decisions that were not always celebrated. I lowered taxes and initiated school choice. Initially
my school choice initiative was very unpopular. However, as a result, private schools became
more affordable for all citizens and these new opportunities for students meant test scores went
up by ten percent across the state. Overall, I believe I made Minnesota better. I was governor
for two years when a woman named Annabel Dwyer visited me in my office. I’ll never forget
what she said: “Lilly, presidential elections are coming up and we at WIG (Women in
Government), think you should run. I almost fainted. I had so many thoughts in my head. Part of
me did not want to do another campaign and be attacked consistently by the media but another
part of me definitely wanted the opportunity to run. Finally, when I was able to speak, I said, “I
will.”<br>
My name is Lilly Langhus. I’ve been a city councilwoman and a governor. I’ve loved
both jobs and I think I’ve been good at them. Now I’m facing a possible new job with new
challenges, and a promise that, if elected, I will do whatever I can to help America get back on
Its feet.
