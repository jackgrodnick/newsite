Science shows he was able to fire 2x more rounds than usual because of their bump stock. He unleashed 11 minutes of fear and took the lives of 58 people and wounded many more.<br>Kirk Wythers, a gun owner, agrees with the thought of banning high capacity magazines that hold more ammo than the amount of ammo needed for shooting guns and enjoying the sport.
